Designing a Standardized Educational Quality Benchmark for Learning Apps
Problem Description
Learning apps are increasingly used by children as tools for education, but their educational quality varies widely. Many apps are marketed as “educational” without following any common standards or proven learning principles, making it difficult to judge their actual learning value.

This research problem focuses on developing a standardized benchmark to measure and compare the educational quality of learning apps. The benchmark is based on established learning theories such as Bloom’s Taxonomy and evidence-based learning principles, ensuring that evaluation goes beyond visual appeal and entertainment features.

The purpose of this research is to create a consistent and reliable method for assessing learning apps so that educators, parents, developers, and institutions can objectively evaluate and compare different apps. A standardized benchmark helps identify high-quality educational apps and highlights areas where apps fail to support meaningful.
Objectives
The learning objectives of this research are to:

Understand the need for standardization in evaluating the educational quality of learning apps.

Identify key educational quality indicators in learning apps based on established learning theories.

Apply evidence-based learning principles and Bloom’s Taxonomy to define measurable benchmark criteria.

Analyze differences in educational quality across various learning apps using the benchmark.

Evaluate learning apps objectively by comparing them
